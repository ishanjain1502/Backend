// What is an event loop ??
// IT is an algo developed to handle the async nature of JS

// why do we need asyn ???
// When we are doing some heavy task we can do one of the following:
// 1. eiter we wait till its comopletion and than proceed with next task.
// 2. We can run it parallely.
// 3. Or run it later.

// but since there is no multithreading you cant run it parallely

// so now what to do
// so developers came up with a jugaad, i.e , to run the process than halt it ,finish other tasks , than again finish this task.
// so that executions of the program does not stops

// although JS is singleThreaded but it shows concurrency.

// what does JS have ??
Js has:
1. Call stack   2. Event Loop   3. CallBack Queue   4. other APIs ... etc....

// what does browser's engine has :??
1. Call Stack   2. Heap Only........

// What is call stack ??
It is the place where all instructions with there oreder are kept

// what is heap ??
It is where al data is stored.

// call stack is just like your normal stack which contains functions
// The application of stack makes JS so powerful that it can even compete with multi-threaded languages.
